MathRent is a modern, web-based rental management system built to streamline and digitize the equipment borrowing process at the Mathematics Department of Hasanuddin University 🎓.

✨ Gone are the days of physical KTM(Kartu Tanda Mahasiswa) handovers and messy paper forms.

With **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **FastAPI** under the hood, MathRent offers a borrowing experience that’s:

- 🔐 **Secure** – no need for physical ID submissions
- ⚡ **Fast & Efficient** – real-time item availability and instant requests
- 📦 **Organized** – clear inventory tracking for both students and staff

Whether you’re borrowing a projector for class or managing the department’s inventory, MathRent ensures everything runs smoothly, transparently, and digitally.
