**A Simple Black Jack** is a lightweight web-based card game built using HTML, CSS, and avaScript. This project simulates the classic Blackjack game, allowing players to compete against a virtual dealer.

🎮 Players begin the game with 5000 virtual money. Each round, they place bets and try to beat the dealer by getting a card total closest to 21 without going over.

💸 One of the key features is the deposit system: when players run out of money, they can "borrow" or request additional funds to continue playing.

🛠️ The game is fully built using:
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for basic styling  
- **JavaScript** for game logic, including card dealing, score calculation, and user interaction

This project is a great example of how core web technologies can be used to create interactive games without the need for external libraries or frameworks.
