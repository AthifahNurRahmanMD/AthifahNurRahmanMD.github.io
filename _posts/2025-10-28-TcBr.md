# Test Scenario, Test Case, and Bug Report

In software testing, **Test Scenario**, **Test Case**, and **Bug Report** are three essential elements that work together to ensure an application functions correctly and delivers a smooth user experience.

They are complementary components in the testing process:
- **Test Scenario** defines what needs to be tested.  
- **Test Case** explains how the testing will be performed.  
- **Bug Report** records any issues or deviations found during testing.

---

## Overview

| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Test Scenario** | A general description of what is tested to verify that the application functions as intended. |
| **Test Case** | A detailed set of testing steps including input, process, and expected results. |
| **Bug Report** | A formal record of software defects, describing how to reproduce the issue and what the actual and expected results were. |

These three ensure that every test is planned, executed, and evaluated consistently.

---

## Test Scenario

### 🔹 Definition
A **Test Scenario** is a high-level statement describing what functionality or feature should be tested.  
It represents *“what to test”* rather than *“how to test.”*

### 🔹 Purpose
- Ensures all critical workflows are covered.  
- Provides a clear overview for stakeholders.  
- Helps prioritize testing efforts.

### 🔹 Basic Fields

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID Scenario** | Unique number or identifier for each test scenario. |
| **Description** | Summary of what is being tested. |
| **Module/Feature** | The specific part of the software being tested. |

### 🔹 Example — Test Scenarios for BMI Application

| ID Scenario | Description | Module/Feature |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **TS001** | Verify input slider functionality. | Weight and height sliders |
| **TS002** | Verify BMI calculation and classification results. | BMI calculation and category classification |
| **TS003** | Verify saving and displaying BMI history. | BMI history storage module |

---

## Test Case

### 🔹 Definition
A **Test Case** describes *“how to test”* a particular function or feature.  
It provides specific steps, data, and the expected outcomes.

### 🔹 Purpose
- Defines clear and repeatable testing steps.  
- Ensures each requirement is verified through measurable actions.  
- Provides traceability between requirements and test execution.

### 🔹 Basic Fields

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID Test Case** | Unique identifier for each test case. |
| **Description** | Brief explanation of the test. |
| **Precondition** | Required setup or state before testing. |
| **Test Steps** | Sequential steps to perform the test. |
| **Test Data** | Data used during testing. |
| **Expected Result** | The correct outcome if the system works as expected. |
| **Actual Result** | The observed outcome during testing. |
| **Status** | Indicates whether the test passed or failed. |

|----|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **TC001** | Verify weight slider input. | App is open. | 1. Move weight slider to 60 kg.  2. Check label value. | Slider: 60 kg | Label shows “60 kg.” |
| **TC002** | Verify height slider input. | App is open. | 1. Move height slider to 170 cm.  2. Check label value. | Slider: 170 cm | Label shows “170 cm.” |

---

#### **Scenario TS002 – BMI Calculation and Classification**

| ID | Description | Precondition | Test Steps | Test Data | Expected Result |
|----|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **TC003** | Verify BMI result follows the standard formula (kg/m²). | App is open. | 1. Input height 170 cm.  2. Input weight 65 kg. | Height = 170, Weight = 65 | BMI = 22.49 (Normal). |
| **TC004** | Verify “Underweight” category. | App is open. | 1. Input height 170 cm.  2. Input weight 45 kg. | Height = 170, Weight = 45 | BMI = 15.6 → Category: “Underweight.” |
| **TC005** | Verify “Normal” category. | App is open. | 1. Input height 165 cm.  2. Input weight 60 kg. | Height = 165, Weight = 60 | BMI ≈ 22.0 → Category: “Normal.” |
| **TC006** | Verify “Overweight” category. | App is open. | 1. Input height 170 cm.  2. Input weight 75 kg. | Height = 170, Weight = 75 | BMI ≈ 25.95 → Category: “Overweight.” |
| **TC007** | Verify “Obese” category. | App is open. | 1. Input height 165 cm.  2. Input weight 90 kg. | Height = 165, Weight = 90 | BMI ≈ 33.06 → Category: “Obese.” |

---

#### **Scenario TS003 – BMI History Storage**

| ID | Description | Precondition | Test Steps | Test Data | Expected Result |
|----|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **TC008** | Verify saving the latest BMI result. | App is open. | 1. Adjust sliders. 2. Tap “Save History.” | Height = 170, Weight = 65 | Data saved and appears in history list. |
| **TC009** | Verify saving multiple history entries. | App open with existing BMI data. | 1. Save multiple BMI results. 2. Open history page. | Height = 170, Weight = 45 (several times) | All data saved in correct order without loss. |

## Preventing Bugs

To minimize bugs and improve software reliability, teams should implement the following practices throughout the development lifecycle:

1. **Understand Requirements Clearly** – Ensure all team members fully understand project specifications.  
2. **Perform Unit Testing** – Detect bugs early at the code level.  
3. **Conduct Code Reviews** – Have peers review code for logic and syntax issues.  
4. **Develop a Comprehensive Test Plan** – Create a structured testing strategy before execution.  
5. **Use Automated Testing Tools** – Speed up regression testing and reduce human error.  
6. **Promote Team Collaboration** – Encourage strong communication between developers and testers.

## Conclusion

Test Scenarios, Test Cases, and Bug Reports form the backbone of an effective software testing process.  
Together, they ensure that applications are tested systematically, issues are documented transparently, and final products meet both functional and quality expectations.
