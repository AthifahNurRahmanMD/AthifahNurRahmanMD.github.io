# 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm **Athifah Nur Rahman MD!** 👋🏻  
Currently studying Information Systems and enjoy learning new things, especially in tech and how it can solve real-world problems. I'm still figuring things out, but I like solving problems in simple ways and always try to improve step by step.
> I may still be learning, but I’m excited about where this journey will take me.
